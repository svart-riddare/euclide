<H2>1. Introduction</H2>

<P>
<EM>Euclide</EM> is a software designed to solve exactly orthodox proofgames given a position and a number of halfmoves.
It has not been designed to do anything else, where <I>anything else</I> even includes user-frienliness.
</P>

<P>
It is distributed as freeware in the hope that it will help proofgame composers check the validity of their problems, i.e. verify the uniqueness of the intended solution.
</P>
 
<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<H2>2. Setup</H2>

<P>
Execute <CODE>euclide-setup.exe</CODE> to install the software.
A folder will be created in your startup menu with everything needed to run Euclide.
You may choose the language of the software by executing one of the script in the <CODE>Language Files</CODE> subfolder.
</P>

<P>
Translators are welcome!
</P>

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<H2>3. Creating an input file</H2>

<P>
<EM>Euclide</EM> accepts as input a text file containing one or more problems.
Each problem is described by a diagram in <A HREF = "http://chess.liveonthenet.com/chess/diagram_utility/diagram.html">Forsythe notation</A> (FEN, also EPD) and a number of halfmoves.
Here is a simple example, my first proofgame :

</PRE>

<P>
The input file can contain comments or additionnal information.
<EM>Euclide</EM> will ignore them as long as the next line does not start by a digit (or white spaces followed by a digit).
<EM>Natch</EM>'s input file can thus be fed to <EM>Euclide</EM> and <EM>Euclide</EM>'s to <EM>Natch</EM>.
However, note that <EM>Euclide</EM> does not do strong typechecking, a position containing an error may be interpreted as correct and thus analysed. 
</P>

<P>
The input can be specified in one of four languages :

<H2>4. Running the program</H2>

<P>
The program can be run directly from Windows by using the shortcuts created in the start menu. 
Assuming you have not changed Euclide's installation folder, the input file is
<CODE><NOBR>
C:\Program Files\Euclide\Input.txt
</NOBR></CODE>
and the output file 	
<CODE><NOBR>
C:\Program Files\Euclide\Output.txt
</NOBR></CODE>
.
They can be edit with Notepad or any text editor.
</P>

<P>
From the DOS command prompt, the program can be run in two ways:
<PRE>
  Euclide <I>&lt;inputfile&gt;</I>

  Euclide <I>&lt;position&gt;</I> <I>&lt;halfmoves&gt;</I>
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
When solving a problem, <EM>Euclide</EM> can be interrupted by pressing <CODE>Escape</CODE> or the character <CODE>X</CODE>.
If <EM>Euclide</EM> is searching deeply into permutation trees or move trees, you may need to press
<CODE>Ctrl-F4</CODE> to interrupt the program by brutally closing the DOS window.
</P>

<P>
<EM>Euclide</EM> stops solving a problem either when it has been cooked (one or a few duals were found) or when it has been verified to have one, two or more unique solutions.
<EM>Euclide</EM> considers a problem cooked if it finds more than one solution for the same strategy, hence problems with two different unique solutions will not be considered as cooked.
This should almost always agree with the author's intention.
Note that <EM>Euclide</EM> considers cooked a problem where the two solutions differ only by which piece executes a captureless circuit.
</P>  

<P>
If given an input file, <EM>Euclide</EM> will ask after each problem if it should proceed to the next one in the file.
Press <CODE>Escape</CODE> or the character <CODE>X</CODE> to quit, and any other key to continue.
</P> 

<P>
<EM>Euclide</EM> writes all solutions found in a text file called <CODE>Output.txt</CODE>.
The file is reset each time <EM>Euclide</EM> is launched, hence make a copy if you wish to keep its content.
You may of course open it with any text editor and paste it's content in your email program for example.
</P> 

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

<H2>5. Bugs</H2>

<P>
<EM>Euclide</EM> has fairly complex builtin algorithms, hence bugs will certainly show up.
Moreover, it has not been extensively tested.
</P>

<P>
User interface bugs should not occur, has <EM>Euclide</EM> has very limited input/ouput.
However, I have already noted that the <CODE>Escape</CODE> key is not correctly trapped under Windows NT.
Use <CODE>X</CODE> instead.
</P>

<P>
Algoritmic bugs will produce one of the following four results:<OL>
	<LI>A crash;
	<LI>An internal error, which will be displayed;
	<LI>An invalid (illegal) solution;
	<LI>No solution for a valid problem. Please carefully check the diagram position and the intended solution to make sure this event is not simply a mistake from your part. 
</OL>
In all cases, the author would be grateful if you could<OL>
	<LI>Verify on the web, on <A HREF = "http://lestourtereaux.free.fr/euclide/">Euclide's home page</A> if there is a newer version that includes a correction;
	<LI>Send the problem, along with the solution, to <A HREF = "mailto:lestourtereaux@free.fr">lestourtereaux@free.fr</A>.
</OL>
</P>

<P>
Please note that I do not have a home computer, hence it may take time before I am able to fix the bug.
</P>

<H2>6. Random notes</H2>

<P>
<EM>Euclide</EM> is divided in four major parts.
The first one, called the preliminary analysis, tries to make obvious deductions directly from the position.
The second part builds all possible strategies by going through a large number of permutations.
These permutations include which piece is which, which captured which, which promoted where, etc.
The possible permutations are built from data provided by the preliminary analysis, without further analysis.
As I understand it, <EM>Natch</EM> does these two parts simultaneously. 
The reason why <EM>Euclide</EM> is so slow at finding strategies for problems involving a fair number of captured promoted pieces is a side effect of the separation of these two parts.  
</P>

<P>
Then, for each strategy found, we apply the third and fourth part of the analysis.
The third part, unique to <EM>Euclide</EM>, consists in the partial analysis of move dependencies.
The sofware is sometimes able to reconstruct pieces of the proofgame and order moves within these fragments.
The underlying code is fairly tricky, and can certainly be improved tremendously.
You may think as this part as being <EM>Natch</EM>'s option <CODE>-k</CODE> builtin.
Finally, the fourth part simply plays, from the initial position, moves until solutions are found or the move tree is exhausted.
The computations of the third part are carefully used to truncate huge branches of moves.
This truncation explains the relatively fast solution found to Unto Heinonen's problem given on <EM>Euclide</EM>'s home page.
However, if not much was deduced from the third part, a great deal of speed is lost as compared to <EM>Natch</EM>. 
</P> 

<P>
Most of the development of <EM>Euclide</EM> took place at the end of summer 2000, when I was (eagerly) waiting for my VISA for France.
A second burst of activity to finish the third part occured in January 2001, between two projects at the company where I was working then, before moving on to Cryo Networks and the <A HREF = "http://www.dunegenerations.com/">Dune Generations</A> team at the end of January.
The easier fourth part was programmed sporadically, maybe one Sunday each three week, from February to May 2001.
</P>

<P>
Note also that the code has <B>not</B> been speed optimized at all, and that this version will never be optimized; it would be a waste of time, as some crucial deduction algoritms (in particular the first two parts) must be entirely rewritten.
</P>

<H2>7. Acknowledgments</H2>

<P>
Pascal Wassong deserves the first place, as <EM>Euclide</EM> has been inspired by carefully watching <EM>Natch</EM> working.
I met him in December in Paris (I moved from Hull, Québec to Paris in October) to discuss of how we built our software.
It is then for example that in one sentence from Pascal I understood what the hashtables were for.
Who knows if I would have thought of them otherwise?
Pascal also sent many test problems and bug reports when I completed the third part.
</P>

<P>
Peter van den Heuvel, Joost de Heer, Gianni Donati &amp; Michel Caillaud carefully tested the program and (unfortunately!) sent many bug reports.
Joost de Heer (Dutch) and Thomas Brand (German) provided translations.
</P>

<P>
Christian Poisson then provided hundreds of proofgames taken from WinChloé's database.
It provided an invaluable reference set to find one terrible bug and a few minor ones.
</P>

<P>
The installation program was created with <A HREF = "http://www.innosetup.com/">Inno Setup</A> 2.0.11 (b), by Russel Jordan, and with <A HREF = "http://www.bhenden.org/istool/">ISTool</A> 1.1.8, by Bjømar Hender.
